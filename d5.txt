"D5" stands for Digital Decentral Diverse Direct Democracy:

A lot of current govermental functions require still analog bureaucracy, which decreases the speed of processing and wastes valuable resources. 
A logical conclusion is to provide a webservice, which is digitally accessible either through browser and on a smartphone application.

To minimize the risk of corruption by data manipulation and monopolization, all the data is hosted as a block chain on decentralized servers.

Diversity is difficult to measure and thus to represent, especially for those who are less priviledged.
By giving access to people, who can have a vote, to the system, they should be able to productively contribute.

Direct democracy is generally difficult to implement because it would require enourmous human resources to process all information by all citizens. If moderated by bots and other citizens and not only by the governmental bureaucrats there might be enought processing power to let all citizens contribute directly to the final decisions, thus reducing the possiblity of abuse of power by representatives. To be compatible with the current representation based democracy, the announcement of the decisions made by the D5 system will be done by volunteers, saying that if D5 has been elected as the absolute majority, that the changes will be applied as announced.

Democracy is necessary to avoid fatal errors which could happen, if such systems were fully automated.

__________

The D5 requires the following to operate:
1) Citizens with access to the system.
	1.1) Creative and knowledgable citizens, who come up with a solution to a problem and does research whether that solution is actually viable and discusses it with other citizens in a thread.
	1.2) Fast and decisive citizens: Their role is to understand the proposed solutions, compares them and decides as fast as possible which is the one which the most chance or least damage.
	1.3) Volunteer announcers: If a decision has been decided, it will be announced as soon as possible in the government if enough representation can happen.
2) Administrators, who maintain the system. The core system will be open source, so anyone can review the system and improve it. There need to be enought administrators, who can be paid eventhough volunteering is desirable, so bugs can be fixed as soon as possible and the webservice is constantly kept online. Only practive will tell how many people are required, but at least 6 with an 8 hour shift to guarantee 24/7 coverage and one person can be sick.

3) Webservice
3.1) Many decentral servers will be offering the webservice as a whole.
3.2) The data will be stored in decentral servers and there will be mechanism in place that the running code cannot diverge from the main repository, which will be hosted also decentrally.
3.3) Decentral anonymized and encrypted user database will authenticate legitimate citizens, which will be 

4) User interface
4.1) A Webapplication will be providing all the neceassary functions, which can be hosted on each nodes but the running code cannot diverge from the main repository.
4.2) An "official" application will be provided, since clients can be vulnable to attacks.
4.3) If the voice recorder of onthewayto.pro is ready, the webservice cann be accessed over the voice recorder.

5) Bots
5.1) There will be bots participating as moderators which will also be open source and cannot diverge from the main repository.
5.2) There is a protocol where the bots try to allocate the thread with the most activity to the moderator bot with the most resources.
5.3) Research bots: They can request to start a new thread, but cannot vote in a thread, can be customized.

________

Workflow for a decision:
1) A citizen starts a thread for a topic describing a specific problem.
2) Other citizens subscribed to a topic, gets notified about that thread.
3) Other ciztizens join that thread, by answering a basic question regarding that topic, which is generated by either other citizens or by a bot.
4) In the thread one or many solutions elaborated.
5) At some point a post will be marked by the majority of the thread as a solution.
6) If so, all citizens who are responsible for decisions who is subscribed to a topic will be notified.
7) They can voce until at least 80% of them has voted and the solution needs to reach 51% of the votes. Until then, those people can vote.
8) The result of the voce will be published to a log.
9) The representative announces in the government meeting new entries on the log.
10) Once the D5-party is elected as absolute majority, the representative changes the law accordingly.

________

Workflow for identifying a specific problem:
1) A citizen asks a question to the knowledge base of the system.
2) The system trys to give an answer using bots, searching in other threads.
3) If the bot does not find an viable answer or if the citizen is not satisfied with an answer,
a thread with a topic can be started.

________

Principles of the moderator bot:
  - If moderator bot removes a comment, that removed comment need to be:
	- publically avaiable
	- the author can request it to be reviewed by a member of the channel if falsely removed
  - A comment needs to:
	- refer to a verified knowledge base entry
	- comply to the publication policy

________
Publication Policy:
 - Be kind, speak truthfully, say useful things.
________

Failsafe mechanisms:
- Human Representative.
- That human representative can request a predefined volunteer of a channel as expert to be present at congress.
- Decentralization of the system.
- System can be accessed with ad hoc mesh network off grid (meshtastic)
- Human moderators supervise AI moderators
- Corrupt representative can be deelected by the citizens swiftly.

________
Current tech stack:
1. Client-Device: supports Decentral communication Protocol (e.g. Matrix) and the ballot user interface

2. Server:
2.1 Public Matrix Server with bots whith one channel, where people can request a moderator bot to create and join a channel.
2.2 One Bootstrapping Node for stand alone Filecoin/Lotus with the "main" cryptowallet, which address is stored in a etherum smart contract application.
2.3 At least two other Bootstrapping Nodes for 2.2, ensuring the operation of the keeping the "main" cryptowallet up to date with the etherum smart contract application.
2.4 At least three independet server hosting a Filecoin/Lotus full node.
2.5 At least one load balancable and scalable server hosting the moderator bots, which stores all the information to a append only local lmdb, pushing periodically the change to the Filecoin/Lotus. (Need to evalutate this)
2.6 At least one decentral server where anyone can browse through the channels, which data is periodically pulled directly from Filecoin/Lotus network, running RSS feed server for each channels
2.7 A ballot mechanism server (there are already projects but with reference to the forum like view of the channel history)

MISC:
- Knowledge Base:
- decentralized webhosting:
	- Decentral Open source code base: https://radicle.xyz/
	- Decentral Domain: https://unstoppabledomains.com
	- Decentral Storage: https://www.ethswarm.org/
	- Decentral webhosting: https://ipfs.tech/
	- Decentral Database:  "proof of spacetime"
		- https://spec.filecoin.io/
		- https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/dapps/decentralized-database
	- Etherum Smart Contract for most important information, needs to be funded

____________
Known yet unsolved problems:
- How to verify entries into the knowledge base
	- Writing history through corrupt historians problem
		- only an expert human can verify, but it means that it will be a bottleneck
	- Black List Problem: Ethical, Practical
	- Bot war Problm (Moderator Bot doesn't work as expected and goes rogue)
- Single instance problem: It is adviced to have a backup device. But having a backup device can cause syncronization issues. Need to think more about it.


__________
Solved Problems:
- What to do, if the system is inaccessible for some reason? (Coup d'etat problem) -> Decentralation (Offline First Principle)
- Organized Radicalist group with bad intentions creates a fake majority (Radicalist problem) -> Black list on Etherum Smart Contract (Black Listing Process needs to be defined)
- Prioritization of Nodes Problem If filecoin is used, the each nodes needs to donate the filecoin back to the account of the "main" node or so called "bootstrap" node,
which address will be documented in the etherum smart contract.
- Fake accounts problem (Verification of nodes can be done by main node of local government)
