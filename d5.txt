"D5" stands for Digital Decentral Diverse Direct Democracy:

A lot of current govermental functions require still analog bureaucracy, which decreases the speed of processing and wastes valuable resources. 
A logical conclusion is to provide a webservice, which is digitally accessible either through browser and on a smartphone application.

To minimize the risk of corruption by data manipulation and monopolization, data will be stored on verifiable decentralized web services.

Diversity is difficult to measure and thus to represent, especially for those who are less priviledged.
By giving access to people, who can have a vote, to the system, they should be able to productively contribute.

Direct democracy is generally difficult to implement because it would require enourmous human resources to process all information by all citizens. If moderated by bots and other citizens and not only by the governmental bureaucrats there might be enought processing power to let all citizens contribute directly to the final decisions, thus reducing the possiblity of abuse of power by representatives. To be compatible with the current representation based democracy, the announcement of the decisions made by the D5 system will be done by volunteers, saying that if D5 has been elected as the absolute majority, that the changes will be applied as announced.

Democracy by humans is necessary to avoid fatal errors through full automation.

__________
The D5 requires the following to operate:
1. Users/Citizens with access to the system.
1.1 Creative and knowledgable citizens, who come up with a solution to a problem and does research whether that solution is actually viable and discusses it with other citizens in a thread.
1.2 Fast and decisive citizens: Their role is to understand the proposed solutions, compares them and decides as fast as possible which is the one which the most chance or least damage.

2. Operating Personell:
2.1. Administrators, who maintain the system. The core system will be open source, so anyone can review the system and improve it. There need to be enought administrators, who can be paid eventhough volunteering is desirable, so bugs can be fixed as soon as possible and the webservice is constantly kept online. Only practive will tell how many people are required, but at least 6 with an 8 hour shift to guarantee 24/7 coverage and one person can be sick.
2.2. Operators to verify users and other operators.
2.3. Moderators: Moderating the discussions channels
2.4. Verifiers: Verifying new knowledge entries
2.5. Coordinators: Who coordinates shifts and other organizational tasks

3. Technical infrastructure
3.1. Source code
3.2. Servers (will be explained later)
3.3. Client devices (ideally an voice recorder developed by onthewayto.pro, but any device with access to internet and sufficient computation power would do)
3.4. Physical location (to send/receive letters, technical support, residence/bureau for personell, etc)

4. Voice Of Huaminty Foundation funding the administrators, operators, moderators, coordinators and the necessary technical infrastructure.

5. Local political party with representatives, who have authorized access to D5 system. So if a decision has been decided, to announce it as soon as possible in the local legislative organ.
________

Workflow for a decision:
1) A citizen starts a thread for a topic describing a specific problem.
2) Other citizens subscribed to a topic, gets notified about that thread.
3) Other ciztizens join that thread, by answering a basic question regarding that topic, which is generated by either other citizens or by a bot.
4) In the thread one or many solutions elaborated.
5) At some point a post will be marked by the majority of the thread as a solution.
6) If so, all citizens who are responsible for decisions who is subscribed to a topic will be notified.
7) They can voce until at least 80% of them has voted and the solution needs to reach 51% of the votes. Until then, those people can vote.
8) The result of the voce will be published to a log.
9) The representative announces in the government meeting new entries on the log.
10) Once the D5-party is elected as absolute majority, the representative changes the law accordingly.

________

Workflow for identifying a specific problem:
1) A citizen asks a question to the knowledge base of the system.
2) The system trys to give an answer using bots, searching in other threads.
3) If the bot does not find an viable answer or if the citizen is not satisfied with an answer,
a thread with a topic can be started.
________

Failsafe mechanisms:
- Human Representative.
- That human representative can request a predefined volunteer of a channel as expert to be present at congress.
- Decentralization of the system.
- System could be accessed with ad hoc mesh network off grid (meshtastic)
- Human moderators supervise AI moderators
- Corrupt representative can be deelected by the authorized ballot participants swiftly.
- Operators of the Voice of Humanity foundation provides trustable operators.
- The Voice of Humanity foundation will fund trustable operators including the supreme administrator.

________
Current tech stack:
1. Client-Device:
	- hosts a minimal unauthorized node decentral communication protocol for discovering a list of authorized nodes interfacing a centralized server providing access to read only access to channels, which one instance can be chosen by the user.
	- optional: hosts a minimal unauthorized node Decentral communication Protocol for write access to channels
	- optional: hosts a minimal authorized node for Decentral communication Protocol write access to ballots

2. Server:
2.1 P2P authorized node as bootstrapping nodes forked custom instance of radicle and  forked custom instance of verizexe (Multiple independent instances desireable)
2.2 P2P authorized node with radicle like decentral repo hosting source code and also the public data (discussion channels, ballot results, knwoledge base) and private data (Blacklist, each ballot votes) with write access
2.3 P2P unauthorized node with radicle like decentral repo hosting source code and also the public data (discussion channels, ballot results) and private data (Blacklist, each ballot votes) with only read access
2.4 P2P authorized node with read only access to public data interfacing a centralized server for quick information access
2.5 P2P authorized node with code review bot, verifying request for change and initiating a ballot of the code maintainance team
2.6 P2P authorized node with with moderator bots responsible for blacklisting nodes for each channels if a malitious intent was recognized, before blacklisting human moderator need to review that malitious action.
2.7 P2P authorized node for quiz generator, submitting quiz to human verifiers 
2.8 P2P authorized node for authorization (of users, operators, domains to centralized server as information source)
2.9 P2P authorized node for managing "main" cryptowallet managing all the Filecoin/Verizexe-coin, which address is hard coded and the private key is typed in manually by the highest administrator.

MISC:
- Knowledge Base:
- decentralized webhosting:
	- Decentral Open source code base: https://radicle.xyz/
	- Decentral private computing: https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe
	
Outdated reserach notes:
	- Decentral Storage: https://www.ethswarm.org/
	- Decentral webhosting: https://ipfs.tech/
	- Decentral Database:  "proof of spacetime"
		- https://spec.filecoin.io/
		- https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/dapps/decentralized-database
	- Etherum Smart Contract for most important information, needs to be funded
	- Decentral forum: https://join-lemmy.org/docs/introduction.html

____________
Known yet unsolved problems:
- Verification process of the knowledge base/quiz
	- Writing history through corrupt historians problem
	- only an expert human can verify, but it means that it will be a bottleneck
	- And discussing it in public channels means that it will leak the information
	- And discussing it in private channels is against transparency.
- Cheating during knowledge tests:
	- If the user cheats during tests (or malicious bot), then it could have sufficient knowledge to stay in the thread and propergate false information. Doing it with "trusted" people, has limitation on expertise, time and resources. For most people a test in a booth without electronics would be ideal, but it requires authorized and correct operation of that institution, which is difficult to ensure.
__________
Solved Problems:
- What to do, if the system is inaccessible for some reason? (Coup d'etat problem) -> Decentralation (Offline First Principle)
- Organized Radicalist group with bad intentions creates a fake majority (Radicalist problem) -> Black list 
- Black List Problem: Ethical, Practical -> If someone does not pass the test, there is a ballot from that channel whether to actually black list that instance,
where the users can see the answer to the question.
- Prioritization of Nodes Problem If filecoin is used, the each nodes needs to donate the filecoin back to the account of the "main" node or so called "bootstrap" node,
which address will be documented in the etherum smart contract. -> Filecoin will not be used, but verizexe
- Fake accounts problem (Verification of nodes can be done by main node of local government)
- No need for Load Balancing if the P2P instances are truely p2p (verizexe using off chaing computation)
- Currently there are decentrally managed domains (e.g. .onion), but there is a need for single point of entry. ("decentral domains" for wallet are not it) -> p2p nodes may offer API to interact with federated frontend servers for ease of access
- Verification of code integrity of nodes:
	1. through homomorphic cryptography and zero knowledge protocols enable decentral private computation, the source code will be hosted decentrally, hardcoding the repo adress into the source code, the code for CI/CD is also hosted there, the compilation is also zero knowledge cryption and the execution environment can also be zero knowledge even though it may be expensive to calculate. It will probably based on nexus-zkvm.
	 Incorporating radicle-repos into zkvm uncorruptable repo
	2. The procedure for RFC (Request for Change) is unchangable
	3. Everyone who manages to remain in the code maintenance team for at least a year can submit a pull request for code review by an bot
	4. The code review checks that the changes are not violating against the procedures for RFC or changes to it
	5. If the code review bot has check it, there is a vote  by the code maintenance team to accpet that RFC to the code base and triggers CI/CD workflow.
	6. Hosting bot instances are optional (Code review, moderator, quiz generator, explainer)
- Bot war Problm (Moderator Bot doesn't work as expected and goes rogue) -> Different bot is in charge of code review
- Representative problem: There might be a possibility for the representative to become prime minister or similar roles for which it is required to make own decisions based on classified information. Therefore that representative need to decline such roles. Otherwise that representative will be subject of a ballot of reelection. If that representative is reelected, it means that the system and its users has reached its limits to prevent such events. One may only hope that the decisions of the representative could be referred as benevolent.
- How to handle local polls? -> it is done outside of the system and thus irrelevant for the system. The polls made within this system are just for making suggestions to the local council and reelecting representatives for that local council if there are enough supporters to found a local politcal party.
- Authorization of nodes and users:
	- Since everyone is free to join, there is a problem of flooding with nodes operated by bots/humans for malicious intent.
	- One solution approach is authorization for instanciation
	- Every ballot instance needs to be authorized
		- 1. Every operator from the identity verification service needs access to the system for the purpose of authorization.
		- 2. Every operator will be verified by trusted operators of the Voice of Humanity foundation and the validity need to be updated at least annualy.
		- 3. A citizen of a specific country from the local legal age for voting may request a verification through the system.
			- There will be a simple quiz about the system to verify that they understand what they are applying for.
			- Then typing in all the nessary infomation (Name, Email)
			- The system will permanently store it together with a unique node ID, but the list is private and it is only possible to ask whether a user is already black listed or not.
		- 4. They will receive an email containing a link and a one time key to the specified address which will start a identity verification process with authorized third party operators.
		- 5. The user is authorized if the operator type it into the system. 
		- 6. If a operator has authorized malicious users over a certain threshold regardless of the intention, the node of that operator will be suspended and that operator will be black listed by the system.
		- 7. All users authorized by the corrupt operator, will be temporalily be excluded from ballots until reverification.
		- 8. If that reverification does not happen in time, that user will be permanently blacklisted.

Notes on implementation of the bots:
1. Code review bot


2. Moderator bot:
2.1 Principles of the moderator bot:
  - If moderator bot removes a comment, that removed comment need to be:
	- publically avaiable
	- the author can request it to be reviewed by a member of the channel if falsely removed
  - A comment needs to:
	- refer to a verified knowledge base entry
	- comply to the publication policy
2.2 Publication Policy:
- Be kind, speak truthfully, say useful things.
- If you recognizse malitious action, report that action actively to the moderators. 


3. Quiz generator bot


4. Explainer bot
